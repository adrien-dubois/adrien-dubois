# Adrien Dubois | Developer Backend 

Hello I'm Adrien, a french web developer, an old chef just converted to make my passion a daily job. First I was directing myself to webdesign, cause I lovea making mockups / templates and wireframe, but I discover the code and it was an illumination.
Today I am specialized in backend developement, with PHP which I love. PHP Vanilla, I made my own framework, but I can work with Symfony or Lumen Laravel. I can do a little JS too.

## My Values

- Safety and trust
- Starter mindset and curiousity
- Love learning
- Personnal development
- Questioning myself
